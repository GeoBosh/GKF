Description: This is a fast and flexible implementation of the Kalman filter,
	     which can deal with missing values and non-positive definite
	     matrices for the variance of the disturbances of the measurement
	     equation. It is mostly written in C++ and relies fully on linear
	     algebra subroutines contained in the Armadillo library. Due to the
	     speed of the filter, the fitting of high-dimensional linear state
	     space models to large datasets is feasible. The package also treats
	     nonlinear and non-Gaussian models and allows signal smoothing and
	     sampling from the (signal) posterior distribution.
