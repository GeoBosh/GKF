#+TITLE: Generalized Kalman Filter

This is a fast and flexible implementation of the Kalman filter, which can deal
with missing values and non-positive definite matrices for the variance of the
disturbances of the measurement equation. It is mostly written in C++ and relies
fully on linear algebra subroutines contained in the Armadillo library. Due to
the speed of the filter, the fitting of high-dimensional linear state space
models to large datasets is feasible. The package also treats nonlinear and
non-Gaussian models and allows signal smoothing and sampling from the (signal)
posterior distribution.
